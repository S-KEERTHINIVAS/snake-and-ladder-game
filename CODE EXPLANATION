1. Initialize the Random Number Generator:
   - The program seeds the random number generator using the current time to ensure that each run produces different random sequences.

2. Declare and Initialize Player Positions:
   - Two integer variables `a` and `b` are initialized to zero to represent the starting positions of Player A and Player B.

3. Start the Game Loop:
   - A loop begins and will continue indefinitely until a break condition is met when one of the players wins.

4. Simulate Dice Roll:
   - In each iteration of the loop, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated to simulate rolling a die.

5. Determine Whose Turn It Is:
   - The loop uses the iteration number `i` to alternate turns between Player A and Player B. If `i` is odd, it's Player A's turn; if even, it's Player B's turn.

6. Update Player A's Position:
   - On Player A's turn, the program adds the value of the dice roll to Player A's current position.

7. Check for Ladders and Snakes for Player A:
   - The program checks if Player A lands on a special square (like a ladder or snake). If so, Player A’s position is adjusted accordingly—moving up for a ladder or down for a snake.

8. Check if Player A Wins:
   - After updating the position, the program checks if Player A's position is 100 or more. If so, Player A wins, and the program prints a message and ends the game.

9. Update Player B's Position:
   - On Player B's turn, the program adds the value of the dice roll to Player B's current position, similar to Player A.

10. Check for Ladders and Snakes for Player B:
    - The program checks if Player B lands on a special square and adjusts their position accordingly.

11. Check if Player B Wins:
    - After updating the position, the program checks if Player B's position is 100 or more. If so, Player B wins, and the program prints a message and ends the game.

12. **Loop Continues**:
    - If neither player has won, the loop continues to the next iteration, where the next player takes their turn.

13. **End of Game**:
    - The game ends when one of the players reaches or exceeds a score of 100, and the winner is declared. The loop exits, and the program terminates.
